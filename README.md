# How to install and run 
Select the project you want to download and follow the steps listed below in the folder.

# Note that downloading the `Selenium-Projects` folder will result in changes in the code:
For every `.py` file look for `PATH = 'chromedriver.exe`and add the name of the folder to the front

Example: In `CookieClicker.py` we would change `PATH = 'chromedriver.exe` to ``PATH = 'CookieClicker/chromedriver.exe``
